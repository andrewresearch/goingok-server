# goingok-server

This is the server side code for a full stack providing [GoingOK](http://goingok.org), a web application for personal reflective writing. The application was developed by [Andrew Gibson](http://andrewresearch.net) as part of his Doctoral research on Reflective Writing Analytics. It is now an open source project.
 
 This repo provides the REST API for [goingok-client](https://github.com/GoingOK/goingok-client).
